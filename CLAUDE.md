# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This repository is currently empty and ready for project initialization. The directory structure has not been established yet.

## Getting Started

Since this is a fresh repository, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project with appropriate configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. Set up the basic directory structure for your chosen technology stack
3. Configure development tools (linting, testing, build processes)

## Development Workflow

Once the project is set up, common development commands will be documented here based on the chosen technology stack and build tools.

## Notes

- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Current permissions allow bash commands for find and ls operations
